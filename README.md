# A-Complete-Guide-to-Dosing-Pumps
The accurate and precise dosing of chemicals is a critical step in several different industries. Even the slightest variation in a particular chemical can completely alter the product or make it unsafe for use. There are several <a href="https://arvindkaigo.com/Pumps-and-Valves.php">chemical dosing pump manufacturers in India</a> from whom one can buy dosing pumps for their industry. This article is meant to be a complete guide on what exactly dosing pumps are, their types, and their applications.  <br>
Such accurate doses cannot be done by people on such a massive scale. Thus, chemical dosing pumps come into play in such situations. <br>
What is a dosing pump? <br>
A dosing pump is a positive displacement pump, designed to inject very precise flow rates of a chemical or another substance into a fluid. A mechanism of this type of pump involves drawing a measured quantity of fluid into the chamber and then injecting this into the container being dosed. Dosing pumps are the central part of an integrated dosing system. <br>

Components of a Dosing Pump system <br>
•	Tank or Chemical Container: The container holding the fluid to be dosed. <br>
•	Foot Valve: A non-return/one-way valve that is attached to the suction line and placed into the drum of the products and keeps the product primed. <br>
•	Pump: Varies in material and size, it has an inlet, suction line and a dosing line. <br>
•	Injector: A one-way valve where the chemical is injected into the product. It is designed to overcome the pressure of the dosing pump. <br>
•	Dosing Line: A rigid tube or reinforced hose, it is generally made of rigid PVC, PE, or stainless steel for high-pressure use. <br>
•	Control System: A control system ensure accuracy in dosing and can be turned off and on at specific times. <br>

Material of Construction <br>
The base material of a dosing pump is important as it affects the type of medium that can be handled effectively. The fluids may be abrasive, acidic, caustic, tacky, very hot/cold, or hazardous. The base materials used possess different advantages for handling these various characteristics of the medium(s). <br>
•	Plastics: Plastic is the least expensive base material and has excellent corrosion resistance and protection from a broad range of chemicals. <br>
•	Stainless steel alloys: These provide excellent protection against various chemicals and from rust corrosion. They also have higher pressure ratings than most plastics. <br>
•	Cast iron: It has excellent strength and abrasion resistance, with high-pressure ratings. <br>

**Types of dosing pump** <br>
There are four different types of dosing pumps, differently designed for different pressures, chemicals and applications. They are designed based on their pumping action and mechanism: <br>
•	Diaphragm (constant injection) pump: This pump uses a diaphragm, piston, and valves on both the inlet and outlet to fill and empty its chamber. This piston draws in the chemical and fills the chamber, then a specific amount of chemical is injected at a preset speed. <br>
•	Diaphragm (pulse injection) pump: This type of pump also uses the diaphragm mechanism, but instead of a constant flow rate, it uses a solenoid coil to take in the chemical and then injects it in pulses. The time gap between the pulses provides the control of flow rate. <br>
•	Lobe pump: a lobe pump lets a certain amount of fluid through a set of meshing gear impellers. It is not as accurate as a diaphragm pump and is suitable only for high viscosity fluids. <br>
•	Peristaltic pump: These are highly accurate for dosing. It uses a flexible bent tube for letting the fluid pass and the flow is controlled by a roller that moves with the help of a mechanical arm on the outside. They are widely used in the medical industry as they can be easily sterilized. <br>

**Dosing Pump Applications** <br>
There are various industries that use dosing pumps in India. Other than water treatment plants and food industries, dosing pumps (or chemical metering pumps) are used in agriculture, industrial plants, manufacturing facilities, medical laboratories, and even in mining operations. A chemical feed pump can also be used to add a caustic chemical or acid to a water storage tank to neutralize the pH of the product. It can also be used as a chlorine pump to kill bacteria in water. A chemical dosing pump is designed to operate in challenging and strenuous situations like high temperature and high-pressure environments. <br>
Dosing pumps work well with a spectrum of fluids (corrosive, abrasive, viscous), which makes them ideal for use over a wide range of industries including mining and mineral industries. <br>

Dosing pumps provide reliable metering, are easy to maintain, and are extremely adaptable to any industry’s requirements. One can find many dosing pump suppliers in India for their industry online on various websites.  <br>
